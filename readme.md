Problem Statement:
The goal of this project is to develop a hotel recommendation system for travelers visiting Maldives using online reviews to identify positive sentiment topics. The primary objective is to provide personalized recommendations to travelers, considering their preferences and needs.
The model that will be developed is a machine learning model that uses sentiment analysis techniques to extract positive sentiment topics from online reviews. The model will then use this information, along with user free text input, to recommend hotels that match the user's preferences.
The evaluation will be conducted by comparing the hotel recommendations provided by the model to the user's actual hotel choices and the ratings and reviews provided by the user after their stay.
The scope of the project will be limited to Maldives, with the aim of providing personalized recommendations to travelers visiting that city. 
This project is important as it addresses the challenge of providing relevant and personalized hotel recommendations to travelers, which can enhance their travel experience. This project is also relevant to stakeholders such as Tripadvisor, which can increase their value proposition as a reliable and trusted online review platform.
The audience for this project is the general public, and the primary stakeholder is Tripadvisor. Other stakeholders include hotel booking websites and hotel chains, which can benefit from better understanding traveler preferences and offering more relevant recommendations.
By considering the audience and primary and secondary stakeholders, this project can deliver a valuable service that meets the needs of travelers while creating value for stakeholders.
